# Class:
What is a class?
This is like our wire-frame for objects. Before you can start adding users to a database you need to 1st define what properties that you want each user to have.  Before you can build a home you need to know what it is going to contain. Is this home going to be a 4 bedroom home or 2?

# Attributes:
These are things that are shared by all instances of the class - Like all users will have the same type of attributes

# Methods:
These are things or actions that the instances of the class can do - Like a user can upload a document

# Pseudo Code:
This is where we use comments in our code or a separate file sometimes to basically brainstorm what we want to do. We use plain english to essentially build parts of our code.

# Self:
Just what is this thing called self?  In JS it would be called this.  Basically it is referring to well it's self or in our cases each instance that we create
